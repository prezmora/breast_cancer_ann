# Assignment Guide: Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Streamlit App## Step 1: Project Setup1.**Create a Project Directory:**   - Create a new directory for your project in VS Code.
   - Initialize a Git repository.

2.**Set Up a Virtual Environment:**   - Create and activate a virtual environment for the project.

## Step 2: Dataset Acquisition and Preparation1.**Download the Dataset:**   - Download the Breast Cancer dataset from a reliable source like the UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, or get the dataset from `sklearn`.

2.**Data Preparation:**   - Write a Python script to load and preprocess the dataset, ensuring it is ready for analysis.

## Step 3: Feature Selection1.**Feature Selection Technique:**   - Implement feature selection using methods like `SelectKBest` from `sklearn.feature_selection`.

## Step 4: Grid Search CV for Model Tuning
1.**Grid Search Cross-Validation:**   - Provide a template or guide for setting up Grid Search CV to optimize the parameters of an ANN model (`MLPClassifier` from `sklearn.neural_network`).
2.**Developing the Streamlit App:**   - Create a basic Streamlit app that allows users to interact with the breast cancer dataset and view model predictions.
   - Integrate model predictions and user interaction within the Streamlit app.

## Step 5: Implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model1.**ANN Model Creation:**   - Outline the steps to create an ANN model.
   - Train and evaluate the model using the breast cancer dataset.

## Step 6: Building a Streamlit App Locally1.**Streamlit Code:**   - Use Streamlit as a tool for building interactive web apps with Python.

### Step 7: Deployment and Version Control#### 1. GitHub Repository Setup-**Setting up a GitHub repository for the project.**  - Provide the link to the repository in the comment section of your code.
-**Commit your code regularly and push changes to GitHub.**#### 2. Submission Requirements-**Specify the deliverables:**  - Include the Python scripts.
  - Provide the Streamlit app code.
  - Include a `README.md` file documenting the project.

### Additional Tips-**Documentation and Comments:**  
  Emphasize the importance of clear documentation and comments in the code to explain each step and the rationale behind it.

-**Encourage Exploration:**  
  Encourage students to explore different feature selection techniques, model architectures, and hyperparameter configurations beyond the basic requirements.

By following these steps, students can gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model development, and interactive web application creation using Streamlit, enhancing their understanding of machine learning concepts and practical skills.
